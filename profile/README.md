# Welcome to Project Zomboid's FrameworkZ

### *What is FrameworkZ?*
FrameworkZ is a roleplay framework for Project Zomboid. It features hot swappable character creation and loading with its own bypass to PZ's vanilla character creation. Create, save, and load new or old characters at any time with a single user account. No longer does one need to disconnect and rejoin the server to play as a different character. FrameworkZ also includes documentation generated with Doxygen. Know what you're working with and why it works too, because FrameworkZ is MIT licensed and all source code is available on GitHub.
